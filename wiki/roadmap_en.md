## Remark
Would you once put together a general blog (adiary or bro)? CMS is important.
I'm doing something similar with microCMS, but if you can get to Hatena, that's better.

## Purpose
I wanted to use Jamstack, but created to separate content and view
Since resume and other places are distributed in various ways, a mechanism for centralized management.
Manage only content.

# Jamstack
Mainly handles view. Any material can flow, but I want to manage what is targeted.

# GAS
Mainly linked to LINE and Slack. Rewrite the contents according to the customer, but mainly for myself.

I'm trying to consolidate repositories and register them together with GitHub to change jobs, but I didn't think it was such a hassle.
