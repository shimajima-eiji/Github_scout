## [日本語](/README.md)

A repository for collecting operational rules and information that supports implementation.

# What is GitHub job hunting/job change/scout project?
Recently, there is a movement to score GitHub on job change sites, etc. It was launched with the purpose of using Github in order to comply with that format etc.
<br>**There was an example of actually referring to GitHub to get a project**, so we decided to start it in earnest.

Since I was originally engaged in engineering, I don't want to lose that activity.
<br>Therefore, some activities in this repository and account are made for the purpose of GitHub career change/scouting, and living is thoroughly separated.

In particular, I am suffering from the sad situation that the information of the huse that I wrote for human resources in GitHub activities is CHANGELOG.md CHANGELOG_en.md README.md README_en.md wiki 絵文字 I can not see it in reverse because there is too much information in my GitHub account,

-For non-IT businesses (public office etc.)
-For IT personnel and scouts
-For field engineers and hackathon members

The purpose is to organize the page for each person while targeting the above persona users.
<br>How can I get a scout on Github instead of the so-called "I left the file for the time being"? The purpose is to make `the point.

Therefore, use Japanese as much as possible.
<br>When you use Github, you should write it in English, but even if you write it in a translation, it is difficult to read, so I do not adopt it.

# Why did you create a dedicated repository?
Even if you normally use Github, the repository and issues become complicated and difficult to manage.
<br>I think it's better to use separate accounts for development and scouting on Github, so it is necessary to think about operating externally and internally while doing things together.
<br>It's easy to say by word, but it was difficult when I tried it, so I would like to promote Github career change while gathering know-how.

I basically use Wiki, but version management is troublesome (I can't use the git command), so I intentionally leave the update history under the wiki directory.
