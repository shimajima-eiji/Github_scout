# Operation rules
The following items will be applied as soon as you notice.

-[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/lalitkapoor/github-changes)
-[README_ja.md](https://one-it-thing.com/4610/)

## How to create README_en.md
Created with `cat README.md | trans ja:en -b -no-autocorrect`.
<br> → If you do this, the output will be blank for about 2 hours due to the API restriction, so avoid the problem by executing `translate.sh`.

You may be able to hook into `git commit`.

## CHANGELOG
Since the operation has not been decided, the commit message is also optional. Except for `README.md`, it is assumed to be updated from the Web.
